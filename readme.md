# Startpage

## About

Startpage is intended to be a replacement of the "New tab" screen in your browser.
The browsers built-in new tab page offers little to no useful information or interactivity.
The goal of this project is to be a personalised dashboard of useful informtaion and interactive widgets
so the user can get a quick overview of all the information they might be interested in.
A customizable homepage uniquely tailored to each users personal preferences.
